summary: Are you under the fallen leaves?
---

<br />
Where did you go, love?<br />
Are you under the fallen leaves?<br />
Then I shall place one below this letter.<br />

How long has it been<br />
<!--Since Huáº¿, since moonlight on the open seas?<br />-->
Since moonlight on the open seas?<br />
Do the stars remember the distant lovers?<br />

As the eggs sizzle<br />
And the bitter coffee brews,<br />
Your blissful scent is missing.<br />

Chickpea,<br />
I miss you.<br />
Do you still dance when the records play?<br />

There are pillows,<br />
There are blankets,<br />
But it is so cold here.<br />

These tears won't last.<br />
Drops fall onto a heart of granite,<br />
Hewing feeble goodbyes on the way to nowhere.<br />

Where did we go, love?<br />
