It's 2022 and romanticism is dead, killed by big data and Tinder. Therefore,
you can imagine my joy at being thoroughly devastated by Hemingway's _A
Farewell to Arms_. His terse sentences landed like staccato punches to the
heart.

Lieutenant Henry's descriptions of tragedy are as sudden as the experiences
themselves --- they are practically seen, not read. But the experiences are
hardly cinematic. They are as fractured and transitory as real traumatic
moments; one has to pause after reading them to realize what has happened.

(During those pauses I have wondered from what mental hailstorm were those
words written ... were they written as quickly as they were read?)

To the Hollywood brain, Catherine Barkley might seem like a Manic Pixie Dream
Girl (initially, I had this perception). Only in hindsight does the depth of
her tragedy paint color into her character --- then, every kindness, every
laugh is truly understood, not as vapidity, but as the gentle resistance of
a heart desperately fighting numbness.

*"We were all cooked. The thing was not to recognize it."*

Cooked indeed, but we keep going, stubborn and blind. And we hold on to the
things that are good, like grappa after a meal or making love in a park or
teasing our friends (and being teased in return). They won't last forever, but
neither will we. 

Incidentally, it's raining tonight.
