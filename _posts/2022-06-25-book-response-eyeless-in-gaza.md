Aldous Huxley's poignance first found me during life's earlier stages of
disillusionment: high school English class.

_Brave New World_ materialized the scattered seedlings of skepticism,
mysticism, and (that most loaded term) existentialism encroaching on the edges
of my youthful purview. The novel's dystopian setting, as far as I was
concerned, was merely a backdrop to affairs strictly internal.

_Eyeless in Gaza_ swaps this dystopian backdrop for a (probably) realistic
portrayal of 20th-century English socialite life. Thus, the setting here is as
unrelatable to my own as that of _Brave New World_. Fortunately, we (I) do not
read to be affirmed by places and faces familiar to our (my) realities; we (I)
read to be transported beyond the limits of our (my) minds and means. And few
lived such expansive lives of the mind as Aldous Huxley.

Anthony Beavis is neither admirable (not even in a self-destructive way, as
John the Savage was) nor wise; he is a witty, overly self-aware prick
occasionally capable of real insight --- human, of a neurotic sort. The novel
trapezes in time and perspective, from 3rd-person to 1st (particularly by way
of journal entries).

Reading in this manner was frustrating (though never gimmicky) for a time;
however, once setting and characters were sufficiently imbibed by my short-term
memory, the effect of hovering across dimensions was like assuming the
detached, dispassionate perspective of God --- at least, God in London, for one
man, from 1902 to 1935.

The book is laden with the volatile conjectures of a young man (some amalgation
of Beavis the character and Huxley the writer). Likely in your reading you will
star your own medley of personal favorites. Here is a representative one:

> The sabbath was made for man. But man now behaves like the Pharisees and
> insists that he is made for all the things --- science, industry, nation,
> money, religion, schools --- which were really made for him. Why? Because he is
> so little aware of his own interests as a human being that he feels
> irresistibly tempted to sacrifice himself to these idols. There is no remedy
> except to become aware of one's interests as a human being, and, having become
> aware, to learn to act on that awareness. Which means learning to use the self
> and learning to direct the mind.

"Volatile conjectures": volatile, because we are slave to fickle emotion in
youth. Conjectures, because youth, by definition, is a state of inexperience.

Perhaps it is to _Eyeless in Gaza_ and not _Brave New World_ that I will return
most often over the years, when (if I am so lucky) steady wisdom has supplanted
volatile conjecture.
